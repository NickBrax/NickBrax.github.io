        <h1>NickOwnage: The Journey</h1>

        <p>
          My journey started on April 10th 2009 when I upload my first
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEr9p5cA1GM&ab_channel=NickOwnage"
            target="_blank"
            >video</a
          >
          on YouTube. I was just 13 years old and I was a very big fan of Grand
          Theft Auto. Now 13 years later I have generated over 151 thousand
          viewers in total on my Youtube. But there is one GTA V video that
          really stands out with over 21 thousand views and still being watched
          every day is
          <a

            target="_blank"
            >GTA V - Benefactor Surano Vehicle Location</a
          >. Warning! Loud noises! This is one of my shortest video's and shows
          the location for a vehicle needed for the Epsilon Program in GTA V.

          After making over 1000 guides, montages, gameplaycommentaries and
          livestream video's on games like: FIFA, Elder Scrolls Online,
          Minecraft, Assassin's Creed, The Walking Dead and Call of Duty I
          stopped in 2016 with making video's on YouTube. This was the time I
          finished school and started to work as a Swimteacher/AquaLeisure
          Instructor and later Teamleader in a great concern in my hometown in
          Assen. It was a busy time and I couldn't find any time to continue one
          of my greatest hobbies which was gaming, livestreaming and making
          video's.

        <h1>NickOwnage: The Comeback</h1>
        <p>
          After a few years of moments on starting making video's again the
          lockdown came in 2020. This event was the best moment to give myself a
          chance of enjoying my greatest hobby again. On June 26th 2020 I
          streamed for the first time on
          <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/NickOwnage" target="_blank">Twitch</a>
          with streaming gear I still had from before. Within a few months I
          achieved the goals to join the Affiliate programm on Twitch. When this
          happened I had gotten the opportunity to expand my channel and reward
          my viewers with lots of extra's. Beside that I started making some
          money so I could invest that in new streaming gear and improve the
          channel. Every month we made improvements to emblems, emotes, my
          setup, streamextensions until we had everything we wanted.

          The highlight of my career on Twitch came on April 18th 2021. That
          Sunday my real life/online friend Lars and I started a 24 hour Warzone
          livestream. We made a whole event out of it and it was an amazing
          experience with our great community. Lots of friends
          (online/offline)and family supported us that day. After streaming for
          more than 3 days a week during a period over 1 year life became busy
          again. Which resulted in my final stream on Octobre 14th 2021. It was
          a wonderful time full of making new friends, completing many goals and
          a lot of gaming! There isn't a day that I look back and I feel excited
          to start again. Maybe someday..
